# hello-world
CSC 434 Class Repository
What I hope to get out of this project - I would like to use this project to boost my resume and to add another project to my github and portfolio to show my work within a team, as most of the projects I have done were personal projects.
Background - I have a strong background in Java, C, and python. My strong suits are in back-end development and optimizing and debugging code in Eclipse. In addition, I feel that I do very well with databases like SQL and mongoDB. I have little experience in front end programming and feel that is where I am the weakest.
